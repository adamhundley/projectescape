        %h4 What is an Escape Room?
      %p
        Escape Games are a new craze sweeping the world!  Their popularity surged overseas in Asia, and
        have since spread quickly from country to country until finally, it arrived here!
      %p
        Inspired by mobile escape the room games, this is a real life version where you and a team
        are placed in a scenario where you are encouraged
        to touch and play with items in the room to hopefully solve all the puzzles and eventually...
        'Escape the Room!'
      %p
        Every escape room is different! Each room offers a completely new set of puzzles.  Project Escape
        currently has only one room, but we're building quickly!  So keep an eye out for new update on our

        %h4 How does it work?
      %p
        The set-up is simple.  Get together with some of your friends (up to 10 for private parties!)
        and book a time!
        Once booked, make sure to come at least 15 minutes early (we recommend 30 minutes!).

        Our lobby is a comfortable hangout zone where you can relax, or play some fun games
        while you wait! Unfortunately, we have to start on time for each group, whether
        you are here or not!  So make sure you prepare accordingly and get here with time to
        spare!
      %p
        We will introduce you to our scenario and layout the rules, then the time limit is
        set and you're on your own!
      %p
        While in the game, you and your team must work together to solve the puzzles laid out for you
        and escape within 1 hour.  This is an interactive and cooperative game.
        You're expected to work with your teammates and explore the scenario laid out in front of you.
        While doing so, you'll be exposed to a intricate back story, and feel like you're right in
        the middle of it!
      %p
        Only Project Escape offers such a immersive escape game experience.  You won't find something like this
        anywhere else in the Philadelphia area!
